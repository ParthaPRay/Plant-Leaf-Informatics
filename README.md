**Caption:** The basics and principles of different spectroscopic methods. The red circles represent a molecule generically. The black horizontal lines represent the quantum states of the molecule. The shadowed rectangles represent virtual states, i.e., states that do not correspond to any quantum state. The energy of a virtual transition equals that of the photon. The vertical black arrow represents radiative transitions, i.e., those involving a photon. Vertical thick white arrows represent non-radiative transitions, i.e., not involving photons. Electromagnetic radiation is represented by wavy lines, color-coded according to the photon energy: violet > blue > red.

**Caption:** Physical paths of electromagnetic radiation in biological samples and their detection using non-invasive sensors. Passive (ambient light) or active radiation can be used to illuminate or excite the sample. Radiation can be reflected, transmitted, scattered, absorbed and re-emitted by the sample to varying degrees. The characteristic radiation can then be measured with sensors positioned on the side of the source of illumination or on the opposite side of the sample

**Caption:** Three competing fates of light energy absorbed by leaf chlorophylls and carotenoids: (1) photochemistry, (2) heat dissipation, and (3) chlorophyll fluorescence. MultispeQ field fluorimeter measures chlorophyll fluorescence in response to light saturating pulses, enabling to estimate the energy proportion allocated towards photochemistry (φII), regulated non-photochemical energy loss (φNPQ), and non-regulated non-photochemical energy loss (φNO). The MultispeQ device is connected via Bluetooth with the Photosynq app installed on a smartphone. The data collected in the field is sent to the cloud, then the users can use analysis tools, discuss and share the data in the web interface.
