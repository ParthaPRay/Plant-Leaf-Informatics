**Caption:** The basics and principles of different spectroscopic methods. The red circles represent a molecule generically. The black horizontal lines represent the quantum states of the molecule. The shadowed rectangles represent virtual states, i.e., states that do not correspond to any quantum state. The energy of a virtual transition equals that of the photon. The vertical black arrow represents radiative transitions, i.e., those involving a photon. Vertical thick white arrows represent non-radiative transitions, i.e., not involving photons. Electromagnetic radiation is represented by wavy lines, color-coded according to the photon energy: violet > blue > red.
