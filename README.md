**Caption:** The basics and principles of different spectroscopic methods. The red circles represent a molecule generically. The black horizontal lines represent the quantum states of the molecule. The shadowed rectangles represent virtual states, i.e., states that do not correspond to any quantum state. The energy of a virtual transition equals that of the photon. The vertical black arrow represents radiative transitions, i.e., those involving a photon. Vertical thick white arrows represent non-radiative transitions, i.e., not involving photons. Electromagnetic radiation is represented by wavy lines, color-coded according to the photon energy: violet > blue > red.

**Caption:** Physical paths of electromagnetic radiation in biological samples and their detection using non-invasive sensors. Passive (ambient light) or active radiation can be used to illuminate or excite the sample. Radiation can be reflected, transmitted, scattered, absorbed and re-emitted by the sample to varying degrees. The characteristic radiation can then be measured with sensors positioned on the side of the source of illumination or on the opposite side of the sample

**Caption:** About 78% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) falling on a leaf is absorbed, while the rest is reflected or transmitted. The result of this solar broadband filtering is that ≤ 30% of incident light is available to drive photosynthesis. Photochemical inefficiency, photonic mismatch, and metabolic overhead further whittle quantum efficiency of photosynthesis conversion of solar energy to biomass down to 0.5-1.3% at mid-latitude when averaged over the whole year (Bisio and Bisio 1997).

**Caption:** Conceptual overview of fates of photons in Photosystem II.

Incident photons (downward waves) are differentially absorbed (ā*) depending upon the particular absorbance spectra of the antenna pigment protein complexes serving PSII, indicated as a green trapezoid to reflect the diversity of antenna pigments and protein structures across taxa. A variable fraction of the excitons is dissipated as heat (yellow-orange arrow, NPQ); a further small fraction of excitons are dissipated as fluorescence emitted from the antenna (red arrow). The remaining excitons are transferred into the inner antenna of the PSII reaction centre (downward red arrows). Of these excitons a small but variable fraction are again dissipated as fluorescence (red arrow) from the pigments of the reaction centre. The remaining excitons provoke PSII photochemistry (σPSII; A2 quanta-1) leading to charge separation and electron transport with a variable yield (ΦPSII), or to fast recombinations resulting in heat emission (yellow-orange arrow, NPQ). If excitation is high relative to downstream electron transport excited intermediates can accumulate. This provokes production of singlet oxygen (1O2), which leads to an increase in the probability of PSII inactivation, herein parameterized Φi PSII, a dimensionless yield for inactivation of a PSII by a photon delivered through the PSII antenna. Short wavelength photons can also be directly absorbed by the manganese cluster of the oxygen evolving complex (thin violet wave), leading to direct photoinactivation. This figure is based upon concepts reviewed in [18,44,52,62,68].

**Caption:** Three competing fates of light energy absorbed by leaf chlorophylls and carotenoids: (1) photochemistry, (2) heat dissipation, and (3) chlorophyll fluorescence. MultispeQ field fluorimeter measures chlorophyll fluorescence in response to light saturating pulses, enabling to estimate the energy proportion allocated towards photochemistry (φII), regulated non-photochemical energy loss (φNPQ), and non-regulated non-photochemical energy loss (φNO). The MultispeQ device is connected via Bluetooth with the Photosynq app installed on a smartphone. The data collected in the field is sent to the cloud, then the users can use analysis tools, discuss and share the data in the web interface.
